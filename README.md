## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edouard, I hope to find projects I can enjoy working on. 

## About me:

I've been coding for more than a decade now, but I've not done anything past the simplest arduino, html/css, c, java, haskell, coq, kotlin (compose), c++, vhdl stuff.

I'm a computer scientist, I'm on the last year of my master's degree and I would really like being able to do what I know can be done. Theory is nice, but there is stuff I want to see in the world.

I'm pretty bad at producing clean code with robust exception handling, mostly because I used to make things for myself, you don't need to sanitize input when you're the one giving them.
